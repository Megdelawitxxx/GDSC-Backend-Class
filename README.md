This calculator application has two main features: arithmetic calculations and compound interest calculations. 
First, the Calculator() function allows the user to choose from the 2 features.
If the user chooses option1, the function asks for two numbers and an operation, and then performs the calculation using a switch statement.
If the user chooses option2, the function asks for the initial amount, interest rate, frequency, and number of years, and then calculates the final amount using the compound interest formula I provided. It is a fun tool that can be used to manage our savings.  
The challenging part of writing this code was fixing the numerous errors I made while writing it. I overcame this by researching more and paying attention to the details of the code.
